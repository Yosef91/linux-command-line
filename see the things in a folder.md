having trouble finding a file? 

well ls lists files and folders in the directory your in.

it stands for list.

you could put .. after if you want to see all the files and folders in the directory that the directory your in is in.

now, thats not all theres much more.

if you want to see all the files and folders in a certain directory that your not in, you could just put ls and then the directory path and it will list everything that directory.

ls -r lets you see all the files and folders in the directory your in plus files in subdirectories.

ls -f lets you see all the files and folders in the directory your in plus hidden files.

ls -file lets you see only the files in your directory.

ls -directory only lets you see directorys in your directory.
