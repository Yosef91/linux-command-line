so, have a file that has no point, well then use rm.

you see, rm is like a bomb.

if you drop on something that thing will explode.

the way to use it is rm and then the file or folder you want to delete.

while rm is very helpful, never write the code rm -rf / as this will delete everything on the computer

I know, pretty crazy right?
