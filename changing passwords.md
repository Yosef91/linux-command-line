use passwd if you want to change your own password.

just type it in and press enter. the terminal will then ask for your current password. the letters you type will not appear.

now it will ask for your new password. put in your new password. It will now ask for you to confirm the password so put in your new password again and press enter.

If you want to change someone elses password then you put(we are using bob for example):

sudo passwd bob

you will put in your admin/root password and then It will ask you for the password you want to change the persons into. after that it will ask you to confirm it. put in the password you want the user to have and then press enter.

the end.
